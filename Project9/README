Use compuational geometry tricks, and divide-and-conquer, to find the closest pair of points in O(n log n) time.
Input will be the number of points, followed by the locations of the points as X Y pairs.  For example
3
10 34
5 17
22 61
Use Euclidean distance.  The sample has three points; easy to solve with just brute force.  
The test examples will have hundreds of thousands of points (make sure your program can handle up to 10 million points).
Print out the distance between the closest pair.

test1.txt -- closest distance 1.0000
test2.txt -- closest distance 15.297058
test3.txt -- closest distance 1.414214
