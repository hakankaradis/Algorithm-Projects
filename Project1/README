Program 1 should be trivial.
Implemented insertion sort, as shown in the Cormen text;  
It's easy to do, fun, and educational.Input will be a bunch of integers, one per line.  
The first number will be the input size, with subsequent lines being the numbers to sort.  Sort in ascending order.  
For example, an input would be like this:
3
57
24
109
This is three numbers (57, 24, 109).  Your program should output the following.
24
57
109
Read from standard input, write to standard output, don't add any other output than the numbers that you sorted.  Please check to make sure your 
program works.  No input file will have more than 100,000 numbers in it; go ahead and make a static array of that size.
A simple program to generate a bunch of data is randdata.c.  Run this with a single integer command line argument, 
and it will generate that many random integers (with the number of integers as the first line).  Redirect the output to a file for testing.

/* randdata.c */
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int i, n;

  sscanf(argv[1], "%d", &n);

  printf("%d\n", n);

  for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
      printf("%d\n", random());
    }
}
