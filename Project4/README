For this assignment, you'll find the longest common substring of two strings.  Each string will be on it's own line, there will be no spaces, 
and none of the strings will be longer than 1000 characters.  You should be able to read the strings in with a simple scanf (i.e., char s1[10001]; char s2[1001]; scanf("%s %s", s1, s2;).
 
Print out the length of the longest common substring, followed by the substring.  For example, if the two strings are
ABCDEFG
XBACMWFE
A long common substring would be BCF (the letters appear in the same order in both strings).  Your program would print out
3
BCF
There are other strings of length three (for example ACE).  It doesn't matter which one you print out, as long as it's the longest one.
Use dynamic programming, and the problem is illustrated nicely in the book.
